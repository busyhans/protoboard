 *    \li 09-30-2012 JRR Original file was a one-file demonstration with two tasks
 *    \li 10-05-2012 JRR Split into multiple files, one for each task
 *    \li 10-25-2012 JRR Changed to a more fully C++ version with class task_user
 *    \li 11-04-2012 JRR Modified from the data acquisition example to the test suite
